        <p class="column">Led by singer Michael Fitzpatrick, Fitz and the Tantrums play a hooky, danceable 
        brand of pop infused with retro soul and '80s new wave influences. Initially drawing 
        inspiration from classic Motown and Stax recordings, Fitz and the Tantrums drew praise
        for their exuberant 2010 debut, Pickin' Up the Pieces. They have continued to evolve,
        adopting a more contemporary pop sound and landing chart hits like "Out of My League"
        off 2014's More Than Just a Dream and "HandClap" off 2016's Fitz and the Tantrums.</p>
