       <p>Lead single “HandClap” is a textbook overproduced wannabe hit: a sterile synth melody, 
        insipid lyrics (“You’re like a drug to me, a 
        luxury, my sugar and gold”) and pointlessly propulsive 
        rhythm. And “Roll Up” – a song they believe in so much 
        that they named their summer “Come Get Your Love” tour 
        after one of its lyrics – sounds like a cross between 
        old hooks by the Killers and Barenaked Ladies, but without 
        the playfulness of either. Elsewhere, the album devolves 
        further into blandness as they sing sfitz.jpegccharine nothings 
        like “I love the way you love me back” (“Tricky”), prattle
        on about how “we fuck and then we fight” in a cutesy way 
        (“Complicated”) and come to the prescient revelation that 
        “the future ain’t no guarantee” (“A Place for Us”) amid fuzzy
        synths. It’s pop without the pop.</p>
